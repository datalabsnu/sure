arXiv hep-ph network, part of the Koblenz Network Collection
===========================================================================

This directory contains the TSV and related files of the cit-HepPh network: This is the network of publications in the arXiv's High Energy Physics – Phenomenology (hep-ph) section. The directed links that connect the publications are citations. Some publications cite themselves, and therefore the network contains loops. 


More information about the network is provided here: 
http://konect.cc/networks/cit-HepPh

Files: 
    meta.cit-HepPh -- Metadata about the network 
    out.cit-HepPh -- The adjacency matrix of the network in whitespace-separated values format, with one edge per line
      The meaning of the columns in out.cit-HepPh are: 
        First column: ID of from node 
        Second column: ID of to node
        Third column (if present): weight or multiplicity of edge
        Fourth column (if present):  timestamp of edges Unix time
